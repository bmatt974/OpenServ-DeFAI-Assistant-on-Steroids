It seamlessly integrates with Twitter, Telegram, and external platforms, offering advanced scraping, posting, and content creation features, tailored specifically for the Web3 and DeFi ecosystem.

## Capabilities :

### üê¶ Scrape Twitter Posts
Retrieve and process tweets created by the specified User ID, filtering them by recent posts, specific dates, or tweet IDs.

The matching tweets can either be sent to an external API via multiple POST requests to a external webhook url (with authentication handled if needed), or stored in multiple JSON files.

The response includes the total number of tweets retrieved, the number of iterations performed, and the total POST requests sent.
Pagination is handled to ensure complete data processing.

- Retrieve (scrape) the user's tweets and conversations within the specified time range.
- Immediately POST the scraped data to: https://example.com/api/v1/tweets using the Bearer token stored in the secret.

If an error occurs while processing a specific user (either during scraping or posting), skip to the next user without stopping the overall process.
